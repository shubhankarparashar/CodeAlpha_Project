CodeAlpha_Project
As part of my internship, I was tasked with creating an "Age Calculator" web application using HTML, JavaScript, and a touch of CSS for styling. It's a simple yet important tool that helps users determine their age based on their date of birth, month, and year. 

I used JavaScript's built-in date and time functions to make the age calculation process a breeze. Users can input their birthdate, and with a click of a button, the application calculates their age and displays it on the screen.
